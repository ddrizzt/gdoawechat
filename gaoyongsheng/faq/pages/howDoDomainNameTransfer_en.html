                        <h3>Complete the following steps with GoDaddy</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Verify contact information</strong>: Verify that the administrator's contact information for the domain is correct (or registrant's email for .au domains). The new registrar may need to contact you on your administrator contact email (or registrant's email for .au domains). To review and edit your contact information, see
                                <a href="https://sg.godaddy.com/help/change-domain-contact-information-418">Change domain contact information</a>.

                            <li><strong>Cancel Protected registration</strong>: If the domain has Protected Registration, you'll need to cancel it. For more information, see

                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Complete the following steps with your new registrar</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Get an authorization code</strong>: Check with your new registrar to see if you need an authorization code (EPP code). If you need one, see <a href="https://sg.godaddy.com/help/get-an-authorization-code-to-transfer-my-domain-to-another-registrar-1685">Get an authorization code to transfer my domain to another registrar</a>.<p class="note"><span class="uxicon uxicon-help"></span> <strong>Note:</strong> Many country-code top-level domain names (ccTLDs) don't
                                require an authorization code. However, there are a few exceptions where you'll need to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank">contact customer support</a> to get an authorization code.

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Initiate the transfer</strong>: At the new registrar, initiate the transfer and provide the authorization code, if needed. This is different for each registrar, so you may need to consult the other registrar's help or support for specific instructions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Check the domain's administator's email</h3>

                            <li><strong>Accept or deny the transfer</strong>: GoDaddy will email you instructions to complete the transfer. If you do not accept or deny the transfer request within five days, GoDaddy will automatically accept the transfer for you. For more information, see
