                        <p>If you want to move a domain name from one account with us to another, you're in the right place to get started - it's called an <strong>Account Change</strong>. If you need to move a domain name to a different registrar, see <a href="https://sg.godaddy.com/help/transfer-domain-to-another-registrar-3560">Transfer domain to another registrar</a>.</p>
                        <div class="alert alert-warning"><span class="uxicon uxicon-lightning"></span> <strong>Required:</strong> If you've just added Protected Registration and enabled two-step verification on your account, you must cancel Protected Registration before moving your domain to another GoDaddy account.</div>


                        <p>After you complete the following steps, we send the owner of the receiving account an email with instructions to confirm the move. The recipient must confirm the domain name move within 10 days. After that time, the transaction times out and you must reinitiate it. For instructions on confirming a domain name move, see <a href="https://sg.godaddy.com/help/accepting-domain-account-changes-1670">Accepting domain account changes</a> (step #13 below).</p>
                        <p class="note"><span class="uxicon uxicon-help"></span> <strong>Note:</strong> A domain name must be in active status to change accounts. If a domain is in active status but <em>past</em> its expiration date, it will not allow the account change to be initiated. Domains that change accounts will have a 10-day transfer lock for fraud protection.</p>

If you do not click this link (which affirms the change of Registrant information
                                for the change of account), the domain name will <strong>not</strong> move out of your account and will remain in a pending update status.</p>

                            <p>Once the email link affirming the change of registrant is clicked, the domain will move to the gaining customer’s account and they will be able to <a target="_blank" href="https://sg.godaddy.com/help/accepting-domain-account-changes-1670">accept the domain name</a>.</p>
